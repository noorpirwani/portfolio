# Introduction

MediFinder is a SaaS B2B platform designed for companies that provide products or services to the healthcare sector. The application enables business users like suppliers, consultants, or service vendors, to efficiently discover, connect with, and manage communication with hospitals and healthcare institutions.

Inspired by an enterprise-level government networking tool I previously worked on, MediFinder reimagines the concept for the healthcare industry, integrating modern AI-assisted search, intuitive UX, and data-driven recommendations to deliver a faster, more meaningful discovery process.

This case study documents the complete UX design process, from early research to final high-fidelity concepts, showcasing how AI-driven thinking and design structure can bring clarity to complex B2B workflows.

# Background Story

During my time working on a similar B2B networking application for a government sector client, much of the UX design work could not be publicly shared due to confidentiality.

To demonstrate the same level of design thinking and user experience, I created MediFinder, a new conceptual project built on similar strategic foundations but repurposed for the healthcare industry.

While the earlier project followed a traditional design process, MediFinder leverages modern AI tools, rapid ideation workflows, and a structured UX approach to demonstrate how creativity and systems thinking come together.

***Note**: The real-world project was proprietary. MediFinder is a conceptual reinterpretation designed purely for portfolio demonstration.*

# Problem Statement

Suppliers and service providers in the healthcare industry often struggle to find verified hospital contacts, understand purchasing needs, or maintain effective follow-ups with procurement teams.

Existing directories and contact databases are fragmented or lack contextual insights, leading to inefficiencies such as wasted outreach, missed partnerships, and poor resource allocation.

MediFinder addresses these pain points by creating a centralized, verified discovery platform that allows businesses to:

1. Search and filter hospitals by type, size, and specialty.
2. Identify key decision-makers or procurement leads.
3. Use AI recommendations for potential matches.
4. Collaborate and manage outreach efficiently.

# Objectives & Goals

## Main Goal:

To create a B2B SaaS application that simplifies hospital discovery and outreach.

## Objectives:

- Simplify onboarding for B2B users.
- Build trust with verified hospital data.
- Enable smart, AI-based search recommendations.
- Design a scalable system for teams and organizations.

## Project Duration:

- Original: 2 months (design + refinement with devs)
- MediFinder Concept: 1 week (concept to UX/UI with AI)

## Tools Used:

- FigJam (flows & architecture)
- Figma (wireframes & visual design)
- ChatGPT (ideation & synthesis)
- Gemini (ideation & synthesis)

# Research Process

The research relied on secondary data, analyzing existing SaaS products, healthcare B2B directories, and supplier tools to uncover pain points and opportunities.

- **Research Type:** Secondary (Understanding procurement and vendor communication systems).
- **Benchmarking:** Compared platforms like Apollo Supply and Medline Connect.
- **User Persona:** B2B admins, sales managers, procurement officers.

# Architecture & User Flows

To design a complex B2B application, I first established a logical information architecture (IA) to ensure scalability and then mapped the key user flows to identify and remove all points of friction.

## Information Architecture

My primary goal for the IA was to create a flat, logical structure that follows a business user's mental model. I grouped all functions into five core sections.

![Information Architecture](/portfolio/assets/images/medifinder/ia.webp)

The five main navigation sections are:

1. **Dashboard:** A snapshot of user activity and AI-powered insights.
2. **Search & AI Recommendations:** The primary workspace for discovering hospitals.
3. **Contacts / Leads:** A space to manage and track saved leads.
4. **Notifications:** Centralized system and AI-driven alerts.
5. **Settings:** Includes Profile, Team Management, and Billing.

## Key User Flows

I mapped four key flows to ensure a seamless experience, from onboarding to lead management.

### 1. Search & Discovery Flow
**The Goal:** To help users find relevant hospitals and decision-makers as quickly as possible, using AI to assist in discovery.

![Search & Discovery Flow](/portfolio/assets/images/medifinder/search.webp)

### 2. Onboarding Flow
**The Goal:** To get a new user verified and into the dashboard with minimal steps and maximum clarity.

![Onboarding Flow](/portfolio/assets/images/medifinder/onboarding.webp)

### 3. Contacts & Lead Management Flow
**The Goal:** To show how users save, tag, and manage leads, replacing the need for scattered spreadsheets and manual CRM entries.

![Contacts & Lead Management Flow](/portfolio/assets/images/medifinder/lead.webp)

### 4. Subscription & Billing Flow
**The Goal:** To provide a transparent and simple way for admin users to manage plans and payments.

# Wireframes & High-Fidelity Design

## Low-Fidelity Wireframes

I began the design phase with low-fidelity wireframes to validate the core layout, hierarchy, and interactions. My focus was on clarity and speed, iterating grayscale "blueprints" to finalize the primary user actions of navigation, discovery, and saving.

## High-Fidelity Design

These blueprints were then translated into a final, high-fidelity, and accessible design system. This system was applied consistently across all key screens—from the user's "home base" on the Dashboard to the core "Search" and "Details" pages—to create a single, cohesive, and scalable product.

# UX Strategy & Key Decisions

My UX Strategy centered on three core principles: **efficiency**, **visibility**, and **data trust**.

These principles were applied through several key decisions:

- Simplified onboarding with AI-guided setup.
- A smart search bar with predictive results.
- Verified hospital data layers to build trust.
- Scalable team management with clear permissions.
- A consistent 12-column grid and modular spacing system.

# Visual Design Direction & Design System

## Theme Concept:
The MediFinder design language draws inspiration from “precision in connection.” The palette mixes healthcare calmness (soft blues and neutrals) with SaaS clarity for a professional yet approachable look. Colors meet WCAG AA+ contrast for accessibility. The typography hierarchy supports scalability and clarity across dashboards.

## Design System Components:

Color Palette: Primary blue, neutral grays, accent green for “verified”.
Typography: Sans-serif font emphasizing clarity.
Buttons & Inputs: Rounded, consistent, and micro-interactive.
Cards & Tables: Modular for responsive, data-heavy layouts.
Icons: Line icons themed for health-tech.

<!-- Make sure there is a blank line before and after the table -->

| Element | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Color Palette  | Primary blue, neutral grays, accent green for “verified”|
| Typography |Sans-serif font emphasizing clarity|
| Buttons & Inputs  | Rounded, consistent, and micro-interactive|
| Cards & Tables  | Modular for responsive, data-heavy layouts |
| Icons  | Line icons themed for health-tech |

<!-- A 6x2 table has 1 header row and 5 data rows -->

## AI Tools for UI Acceleration:
ChatGPT and Figma AI Assistants were used for placeholder generation, layout structuring, and design variation suggestions.

# Prototype & Interaction Highlights

An interactive prototype was created in Figma to demonstrate the primary user journey. This sequence shows the flow from the Dashboard, through searching and applying AI recommendations, to viewing a saved contact's details.

# Outcomes & Learnings

MediFinder explored how complex B2B workflows can be simplified through AI and strong UX systems.

## Key Learnings:

- **Data Density vs. Usability:** Balancing the need to show complex data with the need for a clean, scannable interface was the primary challenge.
- **Transparency in AI:** Users are more likely to trust AI suggestions if the "why" is briefly explained (e.g., "Based on your 'Cardiology' filter...").
- **Systematic Design:** Establishing the design system (Section 9) before building the final mockups (Section 7) was crucial for ensuring visual harmony and speed.

# Conclusion

MediFinder showcases how UX strategy, structure, and AI integration can transform industry-specific B2B SaaS design.

This conceptual project demonstrates practical application of research-driven UX design for healthcare technology.
