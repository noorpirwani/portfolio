My professional journey reflects a balance of design thinking, hands-on innovation, and global collaboration. I’ve worked on creating user-friendly digital solutions, managed digital fabrication labs, and guided learners worldwide through Fab Academy. Each step has strengthened my ability to solve problems, design meaningful experiences, and build impactful projects.
